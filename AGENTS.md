# Public Project Map

This public repository contains the open-source TCG engine and simulator
workspaces. The private production platform is intentionally absent.

Start with `submodules/AGENTS.md` when a task touches a game, shared simulator
runtime, rules behavior, card text, parser tooling, or tests. Then read the
specific `submodules/{name}/AGENTS.md` before editing inside that subtree.

## Public Workspaces

- `submodules/agnostic-simulator` - game-agnostic contracts, shared protocol,
  simulator UI primitives, adapters, and agent tooling.
- `submodules/lorcana` - Lorcana cards, engine, simulator, replay tooling, and
  Lorcana-specific rules/test skills.
- `submodules/cyberpunk` - Cyberpunk cards, engine, parser/scraper tools,
  server adapter, and Cyberpunk rules skill.
- `submodules/gundam` - Gundam cards, engine, server adapter, bot tooling,
  rules references, and architecture docs. Its browser surface lives in
  `submodules/agnostic-simulator`.
- `submodules/one-piece` - One Piece engine, cards, types, utils, parser, and
  rules. Its browser surface lives in `submodules/agnostic-simulator`.
- `submodules/star-wars-unlimited` - Star Wars Unlimited engine, cards, types,
  import tooling, and rules references.

## Private Boundary

The production web app, API, auth, matchmaking services, gateway, reverse proxy,
content worker, deployment configuration, and infrastructure live in the private
repository. Do not add production secrets, deployment credentials, private
service topology, or platform-owned app code to this public repository.

## Engineering Rules

- Preserve game-agnostic boundaries. Shared simulator and protocol code should
  work across games; specialize through adapters when a game needs unique
  behavior.
- Keep game glossary and rules context loaded before changing gameplay logic,
  card text, simulator prompts, tests, AI, or player-facing rules copy.
- Type safety is non-negotiable. Do not add loose `any` or `unknown` escape
  hatches.
- Run focused checks for the touched workspace before broader public CI.

## Change Discipline

- Prefer existing repository behavior and mature authoritative external
  specifications or implementations over inventing a parallel local standard.
  Check what already exists before adding a new specification, abstraction, or
  subsystem.
- Keep one canonical home for each rule or specification. Update current files
  in place and use Git history for old states instead of creating versioned
  duplicates.
- Promote code into shared or game-agnostic packages only after reuse across
  games is demonstrated in practice. Do not generalize for hypothetical future
  reuse.
- Prefer tests, CI, linting, and repository settings over prose when a rule can
  be enforced automatically.
- Keep `main` as the only long-lived branch by default. Use a temporary branch
  only when isolation, review, required CI, or independent parallel work makes
  it useful.
- Keep temporary branches small and single-purpose. Merge or abandon them
  quickly, then delete them; do not use branches as backups or historical
  storage.

## Validation

Use the smallest relevant check first:

- `pnpm run ci:cyberpunk:check`
- `pnpm run ci:gundam:check`
- `pnpm run ci:lorcana:check`
- `pnpm run ci:one-piece:check`
- `pnpm run ci:star-wars-unlimited:check`
- `pnpm run ci:agnostic:check`
- `pnpm run ci:public`

For docs-only edits, `git diff --check` is usually sufficient.
